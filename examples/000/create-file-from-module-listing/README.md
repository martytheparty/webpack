The purpose of the files in the directory is to be an example of creating an index.html that is automatically loads the generated webpack bundle.  The app is processed by webpack and then a file called bundle.js is generated.  The plugin generates an index.html file that includes the Bundle.js to be executed in the browser.  

HTML -> MODULE -> index.html-> EXTEND BROWSER -> RUN MODULE IN BROWSER

html_to_module.js - this file requires the html file.

html.html - this it the HTML file that is rendered into a module.

bundle.js - the file that was compiled, generated, rendered, processed (whatever verb you like) so the module works in the browser.

index.html - this file is generated by webpack for your browser.

style.css - the CSS.

webpack.config.js - this is the file webpack uses to do its thing.

You can see these files in action at <a href='http://www.webpack.peachyga.com/examples/000/create-file-module-listing/'>http://www.webpack.peachyga.com/examples/000/create-file-module-from-listing/</a>.

If you're trying to use this don't forget to npm install html-webpack-plugin.
