    <h1>This is a template.</h1>

    <p>
    The HTML Webpack Plugin is configured to use this template.
    Webpack and Webpack Dev Server create a bundle in memory.  The HTML Webpack
    Plug creates an index file in memory.  It uses this template and writes the
    script tag at the bottom of the body tag.

    It's weird and it's a lot of absorb and then it's easy and obvious.  If you
    are viewing this rendered in the browser (http://localhost://8080) the you
    can view source and see the script tag...

    <h1>Magic!</h1>
